"""Prospective active acquisition: which combinations to run next.

CombiCone's triage score ranks *every* unmeasured combination by predicted
emergence. A real screen, though, buys experiments a **batch** at a time, and the
top-B by score is usually a poor batch: the highest-scoring candidates cluster
(they share a hub gene, or point the same way in effect space), so running all B
of them re-measures the same biology. This module turns the per-combination
triage score into a **batch recommendation** that trades predicted emergence
against within-batch diversity, and supports the closed design loop
(recommend -> run -> observe -> refit -> recommend) that a prospective campaign
actually runs.

Two ingredients, both defensible and interpretable:

  * **Relevance** — the training-free triage score ``-agg_cos`` (the single
    validated feature on Norman), or the refined :class:`combicone.TriageModel`
    ridge score once a pilot has been labeled.
  * **Diversity** — a greedy max-marginal-relevance (MMR) selection. Each pick
    maximizes ``relevance - diversity_weight * max similarity to the batch so
    far``. Similarity is the cosine of the candidates' *predicted additive-effect
    directions* (default) or gene-set Jaccard — so the batch spreads across
    distinct predicted biology, not just distinct gene labels.

Honesty
-------
The relevance score is rank-only and training-free by default; no probability or
uncertainty is claimed. Diversity is a heuristic for batch efficiency, not a
guarantee. When a labeled pilot is supplied the ridge model is used, carrying the
same LOO-CV Spearman ~0.43 caveat as :func:`combicone.fit_triage_model`. This
module never invents outcomes: it recommends what to *measure*; certification of
what you find is :func:`combicone.certify_emergence`.
