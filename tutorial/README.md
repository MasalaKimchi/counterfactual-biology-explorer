# Tutorials

Two deterministic, reader-facing notebooks. Both run on bounded synthetic examples,
require no `slice/` directory, download, credential, or external scientific dataset, and
emit geometry and diagnostics — not a biological verdict, dose, recipe, or wet-lab
recommendation.

### [`tutorial_combicone.ipynb`](tutorial_combicone.ipynb) — triage a combinatorial screen (start here)

The pharma-facing, end-to-end walkthrough of the **CombiCone** workflow on a small synthetic
combinatorial screen with *planted* ground truth (four emergent doubles, four additive, one
low-magnitude "noise trap"). It shows:

- **prospective triage** — ranking unmeasured combinations from the single-gene effects alone
  (`triage_combinations`), recovering the planted-emergent pairs at the top (separation AUC 1.00);
- **certified emergence** — the fail-closed model-relative separator plus the measurement-noise
  test (`certify_emergence`), certifying the four emergent doubles while correctly demoting the
  noise trap (high *raw* residual, but ~1.2x noise floor) — the signal-to-noise trap a raw
  ranking falls into;
- an optional **trained triage model** on a labeled pilot (`fit_triage_model`); and
- how each step maps onto the real Norman combinatorial CRISPRa numbers.

### [`tutorial.ipynb`](tutorial.ipynb) — the fail-closed reachability core

A deterministic walkthrough of the underlying single-target reachability method. It runs on
bounded synthetic examples and reads only the frozen, data-free validation-harness summary.

The tutorial covers:

- the portable effect-dictionary contract and safe NPZ round-trip;
- strict inside-cone status versus a declared cosine-threshold coverage rule;
- the model-relative infeasibility separator;
- why random-gene holdout is diagnostic only, with module holdout and frozen harness
  context;
- certificate acquisition order versus a separately computed realized order on supplied
  measured effect atoms; and
- fail-closed labeled target alignment, perturbation-labeled coefficients, and signed gap
  coordinates.

The notebook emits geometry and diagnostics, not a biological verdict, dose, recipe, gene
importance ranking, or wet-lab recommendation.

## Run

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e ".[tutorial]"
mkdir -p /tmp/cell-state-reachability-notebook
python -m jupyter nbconvert \
  --execute \
  --to notebook \
  --output-dir /tmp/cell-state-reachability-notebook \
  tutorial/tutorial.ipynb
python -m pytest -q tests/test_effect_dictionary.py
```

This is the clean-checkout CI path: it executes into `/tmp` without modifying the committed
notebook. The notebook is committed with bounded outputs from a successful top-to-bottom
execution. Its setup tolerates notebook runners that use `tutorial/` as the kernel
directory while keeping machine-specific absolute paths out of saved outputs.

## Effect-dictionary boundary

The reusable adapter lives at [`../effect_dictionary.py`](../effect_dictionary.py). Its
matrix is always `(perturbations, genes)`, with unique string labels on both axes. It reads
NPZ files with `allow_pickle=False` and supports dense or SciPy sparse **cell matrices**
when constructing a dense effect dictionary.

The builder computes pooled condition mean minus pooled control mean. It does not normalize
raw counts, construct replicate-aware pseudobulks, correct donor/batch effects, select
features, or estimate uncertainty. Cell counts are provenance fields, not biological
replicate counts. Those scientific choices must be made upstream.
