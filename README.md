# Counterfactual Biology Explorer

**Built with Claude — Life Sciences Hackathon (Research Track)**

*What is the minimal set of gene perturbations that shifts a primary human CD4+ T cell from one transcriptional state toward a target "healthier" state — and how confident should we be?*

---

## TL;DR

Rather than reporting *what is different* between two cell states (differential
expression), this project generates *interpretable, falsifiable counterfactual
hypotheses* about **what changes might move a cell toward a target state**. It does
this by treating each genome-scale CRISPRi perturbation as a measured causal
"effect vector" and finding the **smallest set of perturbations** whose combined
effect best matches a desired transcriptomic shift. Every hypothesis ships with an
explicit **confidence score** built from the dataset's own reproducibility metrics,
held-out validation, and orthogonal literature/database evidence.

## Why this framing (and an honest scope note)

The hackathon abstract originally targeted Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) using the
Marson/Pritchard Perturb-seq dataset. **That dataset is a genome-scale CRISPRi
Perturb-seq screen in primary human CD4+ T cells — not AML/HSPC data.** We
therefore reframe the identical *method* onto a state transition that this dataset
can actually support and validate:

- **Primary axis:** Th1 ↔ Th2 helper-T polarization balance
- **Secondary axis:** CD4+ T-cell aging signature (aged → young-like)

Both target-state signatures, *and* an arrayed CRISPRi validation table for the
polarization axis, are provided directly by the dataset authors — giving us a rare
built-in ground-truth check. See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for the full rationale.

**Feasibility on a laptop (CPU-only):** the raw dataset is ~22M cells and is *not*
tractable on a laptop. We deliberately build on the authors' **precomputed derived
artifacts**, which are:

| Artifact | Shape | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `GWCD4i.DE_stats.h5ad` | 33,983 perturbation×condition × 10,282 genes | Per-perturbation differential-expression effect matrix (logFC, z-score, p-values) — **our core input** |
| `GWCD4i.pseudobulk_merged.h5ad` | guide×donor×condition × 18,129 genes | Pseudobulk expression profiles |
| Supplementary `.csv` tables (on GitHub, open) | — | Signatures, guide QC, arrayed validation, reproducibility stats |

Working from the ~34k × 10k perturbation-effect matrix (optionally subset to
high-confidence perturbations and highly-variable genes) is comfortably CPU-tractable.

## Method (baseline-first, honestly benchmarked)

1. **Perturbation dictionary** `E ∈ R^{P×G}`: each row is one perturbation's measured
   causal effect on the transcriptome (z-scored logFC), per stimulation condition.
2. **Target direction** `d ∈ R^G`: the desired transcriptomic shift (e.g. the Th2→Th1
   signature, or the reverse-aging vector).
3. **Minimal set** = sparse selection (LASSO / Orthogonal Matching Pursuit / greedy
   forward selection) of perturbations whose weighted sum best reconstructs `d`.
   Sparsity is the operationalization of "minimal."
4. **Confidence** = combination of (a) dataset-native reproducibility (cross-guide and
   cross-donor correlation, on-target knockdown significance, off-target flags),
   (b) bootstrap **stability selection** frequency, (c) held-out-donor generalization,
   and (d) orthogonal **literature/Open Targets** evidence for the nominated gene.

A deliberately simple **linear/additive baseline is the primary model, not a
fallback.** A 2025 *Nature Methods* benchmark (Ahlmann-Eltze, Huber & Anders) shows
current deep-learning perturbation predictors do **not** yet beat simple linear
baselines — so any DL component here is an explicitly-optional comparison, never an
unbenchmarked claim.

## Honest limitations (read before trusting any output)

- **CRISPRi is loss-of-function only.** We can directly nominate *knockdowns*.
  Gain-of-function hypotheses are extrapolations that this assay cannot test.
- **Additivity is an assumption.** The screen perturbs single genes; any multi-gene
  "minimal set" is an *untested combinatorial extrapolation* that ignores epistasis.
- **Transcriptome ≠ phenotype.** Matching a transcriptional signature does not prove
  functional rescue.
- **The target state is a proxy.** "Healthier" is operationalized as a transcriptomic
  signature, not a clinical outcome.
- Outputs are **ranked, falsifiable hypotheses for future experimental validation** —
  not conclusions.
