# Cell-State Reachability

**Built with Claude — Life Sciences Hackathon · Research / Lab Track**

*Given a genome-scale screen of gene perturbations, can we reach a desired cell state —
and if not, what is provably stopping us?* This project answers that with a **convex-cone
reachability oracle** (a decision instrument relative to the measured screen, not a claim
of biological ground truth): it returns a falsifiable **reachable / provably-outside-the-cone**
verdict for a real CRISPRi Perturb-seq screen in primary human CD4⁺ T cells, plus the
minimal knockdown recipe, a numerical activation certificate, and a confidence score.

## What this is

Each measured CRISPRi effect vector is a direction in expression space. Because knockdown
only ever *subtracts*, the states reachable by any non-negative mix of knockdowns form a
**convex cone**, and reachability becomes one geometric question — *does the target vector
lie inside that cone?* — solved by non-negative least squares on the real effect matrix of
**33,983 knockdowns × 10,282 genes**. The output is not a similarity score but a
**falsifiable verdict** carrying (1) a minimal ranked knockdown recipe, (2) a Farkas/KKT
activation certificate naming the genes no knockdown mix can deliver, and (3) a confidence
score from the dataset's own reproducibility, a permutation null, and orthogonal
literature/genetics evidence.

For the flagship **Th2 → Th1** switch the verdict is *partially reachable*: **39% of the
shift is reachable by knockdown (LOF), 25% provably requires activation (GOF), 35% is
neither** — held-out cosine 0.448, KKT/Farkas residual 1.1 × 10⁻¹¹. Master-regulator
controls land correctly (GATA3 recovered at rank 155/6871; TBX21 correctly anti-aligned
under knockdown), the operator transfers unchanged (no retuning) to a K562 CRISPRa screen (Norman 2019;
held-out CEBPA at cosine 0.878, z = 36.97 — a single held-out target; full cross-atlas
transfer is future work), and across a 12-cell atlas knockdown is never
the majority modality. Full numbers, tables, and figures are in the
[Technical Dossier](./docs/Technical_Dossier.pdf) and the [manuscript](./manuscript/main.pdf).

## Scope, stated up front

Nominations are **hypotheses for wet-lab testing**, not validated targets. CRISPRi is
loss-of-function only (activation hypotheses need a separate CRISPRa arm); multi-gene
recipes assume bounded additivity; the system is one primary-cell screen across four
donors; matching a transcriptional signature is not functional rescue. This is an
experiment-triage instrument, not a target-validation engine. The manuscript's
[limitations PDF](./manuscript/limitations_and_reinforcement_plan.pdf) and the dossier's
Appendix E (Response to Reviewer 2) treat these limits head-on.

## Data

Marson & Pritchard labs, *Genome-scale Perturb-seq in primary human CD4⁺ T cells*
(Zhu et al., bioRxiv 2025), on the CZI Virtual Cells Platform (MIT license).

- Dataset card: https://virtualcellmodels.cziscience.com/dataset/genome-scale-tcell-perturb-seq
- Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.23.696273v1

The raw dataset (~22M cells) is not laptop-tractable; the work builds on the authors'
precomputed derived artifacts, in two tiers (both local, both gitignored — see
[`data/README.md`](./data/README.md)):

- **Tier 1** (~36 MB of CSVs): target signatures, per-perturbation QC/effect summaries,
  guide QC, off-target design, autoimmune-disease enrichment, donor metadata. Supports the
  1-D directional sanity check in `notebooks/01`.
- **Tier 2** (`data/GWCD4i.DE_stats.h5ad`, 16.8 GB): the full gene-level effect matrix —
  33,983 pert×cond × 10,282 genes — that the reachability cone runs on. Read selectively
  (subset to significant on-target perturbations + HVGs per condition, cached), never
  loaded whole, on an 18 GB-RAM laptop.

## Method, in four steps

1. **Perturbation dictionary** `E ∈ ℝ^{P×G}`: each row is one perturbation's measured
   effect on the transcriptome (z-scored logFC), per stimulation condition.
2. **Target direction** `d ∈ ℝ^G`: the desired shift (Th2→Th1 signature, or reverse-aging).
3. **Reachability, then minimal set.** Non-negative weights → the reachable shifts form a
   convex cone; a non-negative least-squares fit gives the reachable-vs-outside verdict,
   closest point, and residual, after which sparse selection *within* the cone finds the
   smallest perturbation set. Sparsity = "minimal"; non-negativity = "achievable by knockdown."
4. **Confidence** = dataset-native reproducibility + bootstrap stability + held-out-donor
   generalization + orthogonal literature/Open Targets evidence.

A linear/additive baseline is the **primary** model, not a fallback: a 2025 *Nature Methods*
benchmark shows current deep-learning perturbation predictors do not yet beat simple linear
baselines, so any DL comparison here is explicitly optional and benchmarked, never assumed.

## Novelty delta

"Minimal set of perturbations that moves a cell toward a target state" is a named problem
(Mogrify 2016; CellOracle 2023). The delta here: **measured, not inferred** effect vectors
(the empirical CRISPRi matrix, not a GRN inferred from wild-type data); a **convex-cone
reachability verdict** with a provable outside-the-cone certificate rather than a similarity
score; and a held-out-gene validity test plus a screen-native confidence decomposition. A
survey of 91 prior methods (2011–2026; 92 including this work) finds none returning a
feasibility verdict on measured effects. The regulator biology the pipeline recovers (Th1/Th2, aging) is what the
source paper itself reports — so regulator recovery is treated as *validation the method
works*, and novelty is claimed only for the method + decision layer. Full argument and the
91-method survey: [Technical Dossier](./docs/Technical_Dossier.pdf), Parts 2–3.
