## 1. Why this matters — the problem the field is actually trying to solve

Cell-state engineering asks an inverse-design question: **given a starting cell state and a
desired target state, what set of interventions moves the cell there — and is it even
possible?** This is the question behind directed differentiation, transdifferentiation,
CAR-T and Treg engineering, and disease-state reversal. It is also, framed slightly
differently, the central question of pharmaceutical target selection: *which gene, knocked
down or activated, will move a diseased cell toward a healthy phenotype?*

Our answer, in one figure: compose the *measured* effect vectors from a genome-scale screen,
ask whether the target lies in their convex cone, and return a verdict with a checkable
certificate — then show it transfers to a second screen unchanged.

![Figure 1 — the reachability oracle end to end. (A) A genome-scale CRISPRi Perturb-seq in primary human CD4+ T cells yields a measured effect vector per knockdown — the empirical "dictionary", with no inferred network. (B) Reachability becomes membership in a convex cone of non-negative combinations of those measured vectors; the Th2→Th1 target decomposes into an in-cone reachable component (teal) and an out-of-cone residual (amber), with "outside" certified by a separating hyperplane (Farkas/KKT). (C) The verdict for Th2→Th1: partly reachable (held-out cosine 0.448, null z ≈ 24, KKT residual 1.1×10⁻¹¹), a signed decomposition (LOF 39% / GOF 25% / neither 35%), and an activation certificate naming falsifiable CRISPRa hypotheses. (D) The same operator transfers unchanged to the Norman 2019 K562 CRISPRa screen (held-out CEBPA cosine 0.878).](figures/fig_central_illustration.png)

That question is expensive to get wrong. Only about 10% of clinical programmes reach
approval, and the cost of drug development is driven primarily by failure that is paid for
late (Minikel et al., *Nature* 2024). The failure concentrates at Phase II — the lowest
transition rate of any phase — and roughly half of Phase II/III failures are for lack of
efficacy, i.e. the wrong target or wrong mechanism rather than safety (Harrison, *Nat Rev
Drug Discov* 2016). The two interventions with published evidence of improving those odds
are **human genetic support** (≈2.6× the odds of approval; Minikel et al. 2024) and
**measured rather than inferred target effects** — the direct antidote to the 11–25%
preclinical reproducibility documented by the Amgen and Bayer audits (Begley & Ellis,
*Nature* 2012; Prinz et al., *Nat Rev Drug Discov* 2011). *(Full citations for these
pharma-attrition figures are in `NOVELTY.md` §References.)*

So the field needs a method that (a) works from measured effects in the relevant cell type,
(b) answers the *achievability* question rather than merely ranking candidates, and (c) says
so honestly when a goal is not achievable. The rest of this document shows that the large,
active body of prior work does (a) **or** approaches (b), but no prior method does both — and
none does (c).

## 2. The landscape at a glance

We surveyed **91 verified methods (2011–2026)** spanning three research communities —
control-theoretic network control, gene-regulatory-network (GRN) inference with in-silico
perturbation, and deep perturbation-response prediction / foundation models — plus the
combinatorial-screen, optimal-transport, experimental-design, and (for the 2025–2026 cohort)
virtual-cell and benchmark literature that borders them. Of these, 34 form the core survey
(2011–2024) and 57 are verified 2025–2026 additions (see [§9](#9-recent-work-20252026-the-wave-arrived-the-gap-did-not-close)).
Positioning them on two axes that matter for this problem makes the gap visible:

- **What question does it answer?** Forward prediction (*what will this perturbation do?*)
  versus inverse design / feasibility (*can this target state be reached, and how?*).
- **What is it grounded in?** An inferred or hand-built model of the regulatory network
  versus directly measured perturbation effects, with or without a checkable certificate.

![Method-landscape positioning map over 91 methods (2011–2026). Perturbation-response, foundation and virtual-cell models (amber/purple) are grounded in measured data but answer only the forward-prediction question; network-control methods (blue) reach toward feasibility but operate on inferred or hand-built models; GRN-inference/TF predictors (green) sit in the lower-left; benchmarks (brown) cluster at the measured-but-forward left edge. Larger dots are the 2011–2024 core; smaller faded dots are the 2025–2026 additions. The top-right region — a data-grounded feasibility verdict with a certificate — is empty across all 91 prior methods.](figures/fig_landscape_positioning.png)

The two capabilities are **disjoint across the entire field**: the methods that use measured
effects answer only forward questions, and the methods that reach toward feasibility do so by
simulating a model. Our convex-cone reachability oracle is the only entry at their
intersection.

The same picture, resolved to individual capabilities and aggregated by family, is a heatmap
(Panel A) plus a per-method disjointness scatter (Panel B):

![Capability comparison over 91 prior methods (2011–2026). Panel A: the six method families (rows) against seven capabilities (columns); each cell is the fraction of that family's methods with the capability (● = all). The measured-effect / forward families (perturbation-response, foundation/virtual-cell, combinatorial, benchmarks) populate the left columns but are empty on feasibility verdict, certificate, and provable infeasibility; only the network-control family shows verdict/certificate — and only at ~35–38%, and only because those guarantees hold inside an assumed model (its measured-effects score is ~0.09). Panel B: every one of the 91 methods placed by grounding (y: measured effects) against feasibility (x: verdict/certificate); no prior method occupies the top-right, which holds only this work. The single genuinely all-empty column for every prior method is provable-infeasibility.](figures/fig_feature_matrix.png)

The headline counts, computed over the **91 prior methods** (our own row excluded):

| Capability | prior methods with it |
|---|---|
| Operates directly on **measured** perturbation effects | 14 full, 35 partial (of 91) |
| Quantitative **held-out** validation | 51 full, 30 partial |
| Handles **combinatorial / epistatic** perturbations | 9 full, 53 partial |
| Returns a **feasibility verdict** (reachable / not) | **0 full** (13 partial, all model-theoretic) |
| Emits a data-grounded **feasibility certificate** | **0 full** (14 partial, all model-theoretic) |
| Can return **provable infeasibility** + what is missing | **0 full of 91** (1 partial) |
| Integrates target **druggability / modality** | 1 full, 2 partial |

The precise reading of the two feasibility columns matters, because the heatmap does show
faint marks there. **No prior method — none of the 91 — scores a full *yes* on feasibility
verdict, certificate, or provable infeasibility.** The 13–14 *partial* marks on
verdict/certificate are all *model-theoretic*: their guarantee holds only inside a hand-built,
fitted, or inferred model, never over measured effects. Most are the network-control family
(§3, structural/Boolean control and control-from-data such as Ronquist [9]), but the set also
includes an inferred single-cell GRN — CEFCON [22], which imports feedback-vertex-set
driver-control onto a *reconstructed* network — and one causally-inspired perturbation
predictor (PAIRING [49]); the common thread is the assumed model, not a single family. Not one
of the 15 is grounded in measured effects: their measured-effects scores are "no" (13) or
"partial" (2), never "yes". And the disjunction is exact in the other direction: **all 14
methods that operate on measured effects score "no" on both verdict and certificate.** So the
two capabilities this work combines — measured grounding and a feasibility
verdict-with-certificate — are held by disjoint sets of prior methods, and the
provable-infeasibility column is empty (no full *yes*) for the entire field. That disjunction
is the gap.

## 3. Control-theoretic network control of cell fate

This is the field that asks *our exact question* — the minimal intervention set that drives a
system to a target state — and has the most mature theory for it.

**Structural and target controllability.** Liu, Slotine & Barabási [1] cast controllability
of a network as a maximum-matching problem and compute the minimum set of *driver nodes* that
render a linear time-invariant (LTI) system steerable in principle; Gao et al. [2] extend
this to controlling a chosen *target subset* of nodes. These are foundational network-science
results (Liu et al. is cited >3,000 times) and they *do* carry a controllability guarantee.
But the guarantee is about an **assumed linear model on the topology**, not about whether a
specific measured expression state is reachable from real perturbations; there is no
infeasibility certificate for a biological target, and the work is validated on network
topologies, not cell-fate experiments. Mochizuki & Fiedler [3] and Kim et al. [4] similarly
identify determining node sets (feedback vertex sets, "control kernels") from network
*structure*.

**Boolean attractor control.** Zañudo & Albert's stable-motif control [5] and the
feedback-vertex-set/source control of Zañudo, Yang & Albert [6] compute node interventions
that switch a Boolean network between attractors; Joo et al. [7] assess the relative
stability of Boolean cell states, and NETISCE [8] steers a signalling network toward a
desired steady state. These methods return exactly the kind of *intervention set* an engineer
wants — but every one requires a **hand-built or curated Boolean/logical model** as input, and
the control set is only as trustworthy as that model.

**Control models fit to data.** A newer strand fits a *dynamical* model to measured omics and
then applies control theory: Ronquist et al. [9] fit an LTI system to Hi-C / time-series data;
cSTAR (Rukhlenko et al. [10]) builds a state-transition vector plus a mechanistic network from
omics to identify perturbation targets; Wytock & Motter [11] transfer-learn functional
transcriptional networks for reprogramming design. cSTAR is the closest conceptual neighbour
to our work in *vocabulary* — it also speaks of "cell-state transitions" and which nodes to
perturb — but it does so by **fitting and then controlling a model**, and it returns target
nodes, not a reachable/not-reachable verdict with a certificate. Where methods in this strand
do carry a guarantee — Ronquist et al.'s LTI formulation admits a controllability argument, so
it scores a *partial* on our certificate axis — that guarantee is a property of the fitted
linear model, not a data-grounded infeasibility proof about the measured effects; the
distinction our verdict turns on is exactly this one.

**TF-reprogramming predictors.** Mogrify (Rackham et al. [12]) and CellNet (Cahan et al. [13])
predict the transcription-factor set for a cell-type conversion using an expression +
regulatory-network heuristic. They are influential (CellNet cited >500 times) and
experimentally motivated, but they output a *ranked TF set* from network influence, not a
feasibility decision, and they run on an inferred regulatory network.

> **The shared limitation.** Every method in this family computes its answer by *reasoning
> over a model* — a Boolean network, an LTI system, an inferred GRN, a network-influence
> heuristic. This is the field's structural bottleneck, stated openly in its own literature:
> the control set you get out is only as trustworthy as the network you put in, and network
> inference from observational data is underdetermined. CEFCON (Wang et al. [22]) even imports
> feedback-vertex-set driver-control ideas directly onto an *inferred* single-cell GRN,
> inheriting exactly this dependency.

**Our delta against this family.** We do not model the network. We compose the **measured**
genome-scale CRISPRi/CRISPRa effect vectors directly, so the "dictionary" of what each
perturbation does is empirical, not inferred. And because knockdown is loss-of-function and
combinations are non-negative, reachability becomes membership in a **convex cone** — which
means "unreachable" is a theorem (a separating hyperplane / Farkas certificate), not "we
didn't find a good set." No method above returns a provable infeasibility result grounded in
measured effects.

## 4. GRN inference + in-silico perturbation

The single-cell community's answer to the same question runs an inferred network *forward*.

CellOracle (Kamimoto et al. [14]) is the exemplar: it infers a GRN from scRNA-seq + ATAC, then
simulates a transcription-factor knockout or overexpression and propagates it into a "vector
field" of predicted cell-identity transitions. It is widely used (>600 citations) and its
in-silico perturbation is genuinely useful for hypothesis generation. scTenifoldKnk (Osorio et
al. [18]) performs a "virtual knockout" on a single-cell GRN; ANANSE (Xu et al. [17]) ranks
key TFs from enhancer networks for a fate transition; SCENIC and SCENIC+ (Aibar et al. [15];
Bravo González-Blas et al. [20]) and Dictys (Wang et al. [21]) infer regulons and dynamic
networks. BEELINE (Pratapa et al. [16]) is the benchmark that quantifies how hard GRN
inference is, and dyngen (Cannoodt et al. [19]) is the simulator used to generate
ground-truth for such benchmarks.

**What they share.** The perturbation effect is *predicted by propagating it through an
inferred network*. The output is a predicted response or a driver ranking, and — critically —
its reliability is bounded by GRN-inference accuracy, which BEELINE [16] shows is modest and
method-dependent. None returns a feasibility verdict, and none returns a certificate: an
in-silico knockout that fails to reach the target is not distinguishable from an inference
error.

**Our delta.** Our reachability verdict does not depend on reconstructing the network at all.
It asks a strictly weaker, answerable question — is the target in the non-negative span of the
*observed* effects? — and answers it with a numerically checkable optimality certificate
(KKT/Farkas residual ≈1e-11 in `reachability.py`). Where CellOracle says "here is the
predicted transition if my inferred network is right," we say "this target is reachable by
this measured combination — or provably is not, and here is what must be activated instead."

## 5. Deep perturbation-response prediction & foundation models

This family is *measured-grounded* — it learns from real Perturb-seq data — but it is
resolutely **forward**: it predicts what a perturbation will do, not whether a target is
reachable.

GEARS (Roohani et al. [26]) predicts the transcriptional outcome of novel *multi-gene*
perturbations using a gene-similarity graph, and is validated on held-out combinations —
genuinely strong on the combinatorial axis. CPA and chemCPA (Lotfollahi et al. [25]; Hetzel et
al. [24]) learn a compositional latent space of perturbations (chemCPA extends this to unseen
drug structures, the one method in our survey that touches druggability). scGen (Lotfollahi et
al. [23]) predicts responses by latent vector arithmetic; Biolord (Piran et al. [27])
disentangles known attributes for prediction. The single-cell foundation models — Geneformer
(Theodoris et al. [28]), scGPT (Cui et al. [29]), scFoundation (Hao et al. [30]) — are
pretrained on massive expression corpora and fine-tuned to, among other tasks, predict
perturbation responses or perform in-silico deletion.

**What they share.** Every one maps *perturbation → predicted response*. This is the inverse
of our question. A response predictor can tell you what GATA3 knockdown will do; it cannot tell
you whether *any* combination of available knockdowns reaches Th1, and it structurally cannot
tell you that a target is unreachable — a predictor always returns *some* prediction. None
emits a feasibility certificate; held-out validation here means held-out-perturbation response
accuracy, a different quantity from held-out-gene *reachability* generalisation.

**Adjacent: combinatorial data, optimal transport, experimental design.** Norman et al. [31]
map genetic-interaction manifolds from combinatorial Perturb-seq — the measured epistasis data
that a reachability model's additivity assumption should ultimately be tested against (and the
dataset our method transfers to; see §6). Waddington-OT (Schiebinger et al. [32]) and CellRank
(Lange et al. [33]) infer developmental *trajectories* and fate probabilities by optimal
transport / Markov chains on observed data — they describe how cells *do* move, not which
interventions *would* move them. IterPert (Huang et al. [34]) is the nearest thing to a
decision tool: it sequentially selects which perturbation experiment to run next. But its
output is an acquisition choice for screen design, not a reachability verdict for a target
state.

**Adjacent: the evaluation-methodology critique.** A parallel line of work asks not what these
models predict but whether the *metrics* used to judge them are sound. The linear-baseline
benchmark [83] and Systema [88] showed that deep perturbation models often fail to beat simple
baselines; Mejia et al. [92] trace much of that result to **signal dilution** — when a
perturbation moves only a few genes, an unweighted transcriptome-wide error is dominated by the
thousands of unchanged background genes and rewards a predictor that merely reproduces the
dataset mean. Their remedy is DEG-aware metrics (weighted MSE and weighted ΔR²) reported
against *both* a negative and a positive control (their "interpolated duplicate"), summarised as
a scale-free **dynamic-range fraction**. That critique targets *forward-prediction* evaluation,
but its core concern — that a transcriptome-wide similarity can be inflated by the quiet
background — applies directly to our reachability *cosine*, which is likewise scored over all
genes. We therefore adopted its machinery to stress-test our own verdict (RESULTS §6.5 and
`notebooks/08_deg_weighted_evaluation.ipynb`): under DEG weighting the Th2→Th1 conclusion is
preserved and in fact strengthens (reachable cosine 0.63 → 0.80, held-out z 28 → 14, both far
above the significance floor), confirming it is not a dilution artifact. The unweighted default
reproduces every previously published number bit-for-bit, so the addition is non-breaking.

**Our delta.** We turn the measured effects these models predict *into an inverse-design
oracle*. Prediction is necessary but not sufficient: knowing every perturbation's response
does not tell you whether a target is in their reachable set. Convex geometry closes that gap —
and, uniquely, closes it in a way that can return "no, and here is the missing direction."

---

## 6. The pain point, and how our methodology addresses it

**The pain point, stated once.** Existing methods either (i) rank or predict on *measured*
data but never certify achievability, or (ii) reason about achievability but only inside an
*inferred or hand-built model* whose error they cannot bound. A target-selection team is
therefore left with optimistic rankings and model-dependent simulations — and, crucially, with
no principled way to be told *"stop: this goal is not reachable by this modality."* Since late
efficacy failure is the dominant cost of drug development (§1), the missing capability — a
credible, early, measured-grounded *stop* — is exactly the expensive one.

**How the convex-cone reachability oracle addresses it.** Four design choices map onto the
four gaps:

1. **Measured, not modelled (addresses the §3–§4 model-dependence).** The cone's generators
   are the empirically observed genome-scale CRISPRi effect vectors in the relevant primary
   human cell type. There is no network to infer and no inference error to propagate.
2. **A verdict with a certificate (addresses the §3–§5 "ranking/prediction only").**
   Non-negative least squares over the effect cone is a convex program; its KKT/Farkas
   conditions give a numerically checkable optimality certificate. "Reachable" comes with the
   mixing weights (the recipe); "unreachable" comes with a separating hyperplane and the
   specific genes in the residual direction that would need to be *activated* — a constructive
   output no surveyed method produces.
3. **Held-out-gene validation + a target-specific null (addresses inflated in-sample fit).**
   We fit weights on a random half of the target signature's genes and score alignment on the
   held-out half, and we compare every verdict against a shuffled-target null. On Th2→Th1 in
   resting CD4⁺ T cells the held-out cosine is 0.448 at a null z of 24.4; the target decomposes
   into 39% reachable by knockdown / 31% activation-required / 30% orthogonal. The method
   transfers *unchanged* to the Norman K562 CRISPRa screen [31], where held-out CEBPA is
   partially reachable (cosine 0.878, null z ≈37, held-out-gene z ≈23.5) and measured
   double-perturbations let us confirm additivity is a bounded approximation (median cosine
   0.71, sum-of-singles vs. measured) — a check the singles-only T-cell screen could not do.
4. **A modality-resolved, druggability-cross-referenced triage (addresses the §5 single
   druggability entry).** Because the cone is signed (LOF vs. GOF), every required node carries
   a modality; crossing that with Open Targets tractability turns the verdict into a triage.
   The decision-relevant finding: 44% of the required knockdown nodes across the atlas are
   hard-to-drug, and the strongest genetically-supported node among them (IRF1, 17 immune-
   disease genetic associations) has no conventional drug handle at all.

The same four design choices, read as *decisions a drug-development team makes* rather than
method properties, are what turn the oracle into a triage instrument:

![How the oracle is useful to a drug-development team. (A) The decision it makes — a desired cell-state change is routed to GO (reachable → put the minimal ranked knockdown set in the screen), STOP (provably outside the cone → don't spend a CRISPRi arm), or REDIRECT (activation-required → switch to CRISPRa; the certificate names the genes). The GO branch feeds a modality triage over 102 real nominations (44% hard-to-drug; 10 with a clinical-grade drug), separating green-light (JAK2, ICOS, MAPK14, CD3D), tractable-but-untried (IL7R, ZAP70, TET2), and required-but-undruggable (IRF1) tiers. (B) Four value levers mapped onto the drug-development attrition funnel (≈10% reach approval; Phase II is the lowest transition at 30.7%; ~half of Phase II/III failures are lack of efficacy). Nominations are wet-lab hypotheses, not validated targets; this is a prioritisation-and-triage instrument, not a claimed hit rate.](figures/fig_impact_usecase.png)

### The two results that show the machinery working

The reachability *spectrum* is the honesty figure — the observed alignment rises far above a
shuffled-target null band at every recipe size, then plateaus well below 1, which is the
correct behaviour for a partially-reachable target:

![Reachability spectrum for Th2→Th1 by knockdown. The observed alignment (blue) rises to ~0.46 and plateaus, with a knee at k=7; the shuffled-target null band (grey) sits far below (~0.05–0.15) at every recipe size. The gap between the two is the signal; the plateau below 1 is the honest ceiling of loss-of-function alone.](figures/fig1_reachability_spectrum.png)

And the decomposition + **activation certificate** is the output no prior method produces —
the target splits into what knockdown can reach and what it provably cannot, and the
unreachable direction is resolved into named genes that a CRISPRa arm would have to test:

![Left: the Th2→Th1 target splits into 39% reachable by knockdown, 31% activation-required, 30% orthogonal residual. Right: the activation certificate names the genes carrying the unmet upward demand (LYAR, IKZF3, CRTAM, LAG3, …) — concrete, wet-lab-testable CRISPRa hypotheses, with immune-function genes marked.](figures/fig2_decomposition_certificate.png)

---

## 7. Positioning summary — the one-paragraph delta

Prior cell-fate-control methods either simulate an **inferred or hand-built model** to reason
about achievability (structural/Boolean control [1–8], control-from-data [9–11], TF predictors
[12–13], GRN in-silico perturbation [14–22]) or **predict responses** from measured data
without ever asking achievability (perturbation-ML [23–27], foundation models [28–30],
combinatorial/OT/design [31–34]). We compose the **measured** effect vectors directly and, via
the convex geometry that loss-of-function non-negativity forces, return a **reachable /
provably-outside-the-cone verdict with a constructive certificate**, validated by held-out-gene
generalisation and resolved to intervention modality. We claim novelty for this
measured-effect, certificate-carrying reachability *decision* — not for the Th1/Th2 or CEBPA
regulator lists, which the source screens already report and which we use only as positive
controls.

*See `NOVELTY.md` §2 for the full novelty argument and its impact section for the translational
use cases.*

## 9. Recent work (2025–2026) — the wave arrived, the gap did not close

The 2024 survey above could have aged badly: 2025–2026 has been the most active two-year
period this field has seen, dominated by the "virtual cell" programme and a flood of large
perturbation models. We therefore re-ran the search over 2025–2026 only and verified **57
additional methods** against primary records (real DOIs/PMIDs; machine-readable in
`references.csv`, cohort `2025-2026`). The headline is that the wave populated the *same*
regions of the landscape and left the decisive corner empty. Across all 91 methods, the count
of prior methods that return a feasibility verdict, emit a data-grounded certificate, or prove
infeasibility is still **zero**. The prose below names representative exemplars per family; the
complete set of 57 (entries [35]–[91]) is in [§8](#8-references) and `references.csv`.

**The virtual-cell / large-model surge (forward predictors, at scale).** Arc Institute's
**State** [47] is an explicit perturbation model trained across cell contexts; **TranscriptFormer**
[64], **scPRINT** [63], **CellFM** [69], **Nicheformer** [67] and the Cell2Sentence-scale LLM
approach **C2S-Scale** [66] extend the foundation-model line; **GET** [62] predicts expression
from regulatory sequence; **TxPert** [60] targets transcriptional perturbation response. The
community also formalised the goal itself — the **Virtual Cell Challenge** [74] and the
"AI virtual cell" roadmap pieces [73] — and released the data substrate for it, notably the
**Tahoe-100M** perturbation atlas [91] and the **moscot** scaling of optimal transport to
atlas-scale [81]. Every one of these is, by construction, a *forward* model or a dataset: it
predicts a response, embeds a cell, or provides training data. None returns a reachable /
provably-outside verdict, a minimal knockdown recipe, or a Farkas/KKT certificate — the gap our
method fills is orthogonal to what scaling a predictor buys.

**The critical-benchmark literature (which strengthens our design choice).** The most
decision-relevant 2025 development is a cluster of careful benchmarks reporting that current
perturbation-prediction models — including the foundation models — often **fail to beat simple
mean or linear baselines** on genuinely unseen perturbations: Ahlmann-Eltze et al. [83],
Wong et al. [54], Csendes et al. [84], Kedzierska et al. [85], Wu et al. [90], Systema
(Viñas et al. [88]), Kernfeld et al. [86], Wei et al. [89], and the Open Problems effort
[87]. This is not a criticism we need to make from the outside; the field is making it of
itself. It also sharpens our positioning: if forward prediction on unseen perturbations is
this fragile, then a method whose output is a *feasibility verdict computed directly from the
measured effects* — one that does not extrapolate to unseen perturbations at all, and that
comes with a checkable certificate and a shuffled-target null — is attacking exactly the
reliability gap these benchmarks expose. Our claim is deliberately weaker and therefore more
defensible than "predict the response of an unseen perturbation."

**Network control did not stand still either.** New Boolean/structural-control work — biobalm
succession diagrams (Trinh et al. [38]), modular Boolean control (Murrugarra et al. [37]),
trap-space control (Cifuentes-Fontanals et al. [35]), stable-motif control in multicellular
models (Metzcar et al. [36]), and biomolecular feedback control (Vecchio et al. [39]) —
continues to produce genuine control strategies, and these are the 2025–2026 methods that
score *partial* on our verdict/certificate axes. As with their pre-2024 predecessors, the
guarantee is a theorem about a hand-built or inferred model, not a certificate over measured
effects; they sit in the same lower/right model-theoretic region of the landscape, not in the
measured-and-certified corner.

**Net effect on the positioning.** Adding 57 verified 2025–2026 methods did not move a single
entry into the top-right quadrant. It did the opposite: it enlarged the measured-but-forward
cloud (more predictors), enlarged the model-theoretic-feasibility cloud (more Boolean control),
and — through the benchmark papers — supplied independent evidence that the forward-prediction
strategy those clouds represent is unreliable on unseen perturbations. The measured-effect,
certificate-carrying reachability verdict remains, as of 2026, unoccupied by any other method
we could verify.
