# External data

Scientific source data stay local and are ignored by Git. The repository ships a compact
frozen evidence bundle and a data-free validation harness, not the large source matrices.

## Primary source: Zhu et al.

Genome-scale CRISPRi Perturb-seq in primary human CD4 cells from four donors and three
assay conditions:

Highest-priority objects:

| Object | Bytes | Use |

Frozen source identities used by `configs/source_reconstruction.json`:

| Object | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `GWCD4i.DE_stats.h5ad` | `c355f535ff32cf7ba1edc49cf9c6039fe84f2c9ebe4d005515cba75790cfbb62` |

The target CSV is pinned to author commit
[`848d62f`](https://github.com/emdann/GWT_perturbseq_analysis_2025/tree/848d62fc2b7027f7218d6fc5f5b0c37255dc94af),
not the mutable default branch.

The VCP schema also documents `Th1Th2_validation_summary.suppl_table.csv`, but no working
public S3 or author-repository object was verified on 2026-07-17. Treat retrieval as
unresolved; do not present this table as an executable benchmark until a source route is
confirmed.

Download one allow-listed object with:

```bash
./data/fetch_de_stats.sh Th2_Th1_polarization_signature_DE_results_full.suppl_table.csv
```

The default remains `GWCD4i.DE_stats.h5ad`. Downloads use a `.part` path and verify the
registered byte length before atomic rename. The helper does not provide resumable S3
transfer; interrupted large downloads must be restarted. Record SHA-256 and retrieval date
in the dataset card before analysis.

With both frozen files present, run the source-bound reconstruction separately from the
small CI suite:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-external.txt
python scripts/run_source_reconstruction.py --profile
python scripts/run_source_reconstruction.py --check results/source_reconstruction.json
```

This reconstructs target lineage and aggregate-screen source-transfer diagnostics. It
does not substitute for donor- or guide-level objects.

## Target sources

- Ota et al., *Cell* 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.056, NBDC E-GEAD-397.
- Höllbacher et al., *ImmunoHorizons* 2020, DOI
  10.4049/immunohorizons.2000037, GEO GSE149090.

The current target uses the Zhu supplementary polarization table. Its registered merged
analysis has 6,188 genes after requiring both sources, concordant signs, and screen
measurement. Source-transfer validation must return to the independent Ota and
Höllbacher inputs and must not select coordinates using the held-out source.

## Compact independent benchmarks

These archives are small enough to exercise the external-data harness before downloading
the 17–45 GB donor/guide/pseudobulk objects:

| Dataset | Exact archive | Bytes | Terms and allowed use |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Arce Perturb-CITE, Zenodo 13924126 / GSE278572 | [`data_tables.zip`](https://zenodo.org/api/records/13924126/files/data_tables.zip/content), MD5 `886ed0fea0b9dc0625355c2e4928077c`, SHA-256 `dc9e2efb04d24f1a6d4b8db6a8b1d5cd01c935777c3740088be339de5b5062b4` | 57,967,623 | **Implemented**: S1 CRISPRi-transcript → CRISPR-KO CD25 transfer and S14/S8 donor/guide supplied-score robustness; not state or donor-population validation |
| Schmidt screens, Zenodo 5784651 / GSE174292 | [`Genome-wide-screens.zip`](https://zenodo.org/api/records/5784651/files/Genome-wide-screens.zip/content), upstream MD5 `e0392eb7b2512720bb8cbf705ce9854f` | 26,152,593 | CC-BY-4.0; CRISPRa/CRISPRi orientation and IFNG/IL2 transfer with only two donors |

The Arce runner verifies the archive plus S1/S8/S14 workbook bytes, requires four guides in every
screen context, freezes Zhu `Rest` admission before reading Arce outcomes, and checks the
current deterministic evidence:

```bash
python scripts/run_arce_external_validation.py --check
```

The retained S1 benchmark has 1,347 four-guide genes, 1,259 present in the Zhu `Rest`
dictionary, and 480 source-admitted analysis targets. S1 is aggregate and cannot supply
donor uncertainty. Arce S9 is significant-only (absence is censored, never zero), and S4
contains unlabelled technical replicates that must be aggregated within biological key.
Schmidt's cell-level marker tables are likewise not donor-level inference.

S14 contributes 100,087 singlet cells, 520 complete guide×donor×context strata, and four
contexts. S8's 116 pooled summaries are exactly reproduced but are not independent data;
its pooled-cell tests are excluded. The supplied `activation.score` lacks a frozen local
formula/gene set and is used only for descriptive within-object robustness.

## Next dataset priorities

- Schmidt primary-T-cell CRISPRa/CRISPRi: GSE174292 and subseries GSE174255,
  GSE190604, GSE190846.
- Goudy primary-T-cell CRISPRoff/Cas9: GSE306915; descriptive only until sample mapping
  and reuse terms are resolved.
- Zhu donor/guide objects above, after compact benchmark calibration is stable.

See [`docs/SCIENTIFIC_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](../docs/SCIENTIFIC_VALIDATION_PLAN.md) for
the exact evaluation and claim ceiling for each resource.

## Data policy

- Never force-add H5AD, H5MU, CSV, NPZ, or raw-count payloads under `data/`.
- Every analysis input needs an accession, exact object key, version/retrieval date,
  byte length, SHA-256, license/terms status, gene namespace, orientation, units,
  donor/guide/context/batch fields, and missingness profile.
- A missing donor or guide estimate remains missing; it is never silently replaced by a
  collapsed average.
- Claim-bearing tables must be regenerated by the external-data runner, not copied from
  an interactive notebook.
