"""Convex-cone reachability for cell-state engineering.

The headline method for the cell-state-reachability project. Given a dictionary of
*measured* CRISPRi knockdown effect vectors `E` (P perturbations x G genes) and a target
transcriptomic shift `d` (G,), it answers a feasibility question, not a ranking one:

    Is `d` reachable by some NON-NEGATIVE combination of knockdown effects
    (i.e. is `d` inside the convex cone spanned by the rows of E), and if not,
    which genes make it unreachable (the constructive infeasibility certificate)?

Why a cone (the whole method in two facts):
  1. CRISPRi is loss-of-function: you can apply a knockdown or not, you cannot apply a
     "negative knockdown". So combination weights are non-negative: w >= 0.
  2. You can co-perturb: several knockdowns at once => the effect is (assumed) additive.
Together, the reachable set is C = { E^T w : w >= 0 } — a finitely generated convex
cone. Testing d in C is a non-negative least squares (NNLS) problem.

What makes the verdict falsifiable and honest:
  * reachable  -> residual ~ 0; the weights w rank a candidate perturbation mixture.
  * outside    -> residual has a component NO non-negative mix can supply. We return the
                  Farkas separating direction rho = d - E^T w*. Its positive coordinates
                  rank readouts that remain under-delivered at the closest cone point. They
                  motivate, but do not validate, concrete CRISPRa/de-repression hypotheses.
  * "meaningfully outside" is decided against a SHUFFLED-TARGET null, never a hardcoded
    threshold, because with P<<G most random targets are partly outside by construction.

Signed / bidirectional extension (`signed_reachability`):
  The one-sided cone above answers "how far can KNOCKDOWN get?". The signed solver answers
  the modality question: after fitting the measured loss-of-function (knockdown) cone, it
  fits the remaining residual with hypothetical gain-of-function atoms modelled as sign-flips
  of measured knockdown effects. It returns a sequential Pythagorean split of the target norm into
  LOF-reachable / GOF-only / neither (they sum to 1). This turns "31% needs activation" into
  a model-based variance decomposition with a knockdown recipe AND a candidate activation recipe, and is
  the geometric basis for modality triage (inhibit/degrade vs activate/agonize vs undruggable).

Dependencies: numpy, scipy.optimize.nnls. CPU-cheap (seconds at 34k x 2k). No GPU, no torch.

# Every null / held-out / bootstrap loop refits NNLS on a FIXED dictionary A = E^T while
# only the right-hand side changes. scipy.optimize.nnls re-derives its normal-equation
# quantities from A on every call. Two accelerations below leave the numerical result at
# the SAME optimum (identical support, cosine, KKT certificate) while removing that waste:
#
#   (1) Gram reuse  — precompute G = A^T A once and run a Gram-based Lawson-Hanson active
#       set, so each solve works in the small P-dimensional passive subspace instead of
#       rescanning the (G x P) matrix. Guarded: every Gram solve is verified against the
#       method's own KKT/Farkas certificate (max_p <e_p, rho> <= tol); if it fails the
#       optimality bound (ill-conditioned Gram) or raises, we fall back to exact scipy.nnls.
#
#   (2) Process parallelism — the shuffles/resamples are independent, but scipy's compiled
#       _nnls holds the GIL (threads give no speedup), so parallelism must be process-based.
#       A fork pool COW-inherits the dictionary; one BLAS thread per worker avoids
#       oversubscription. Falls back to serial if fork is unavailable (Windows/spawn) or
#       blocked (sandboxed semaphores) — so reproduction is deterministic on any platform.
#
# The single-solve public API (reachability, signed_reachability) is intentionally NOT
# routed through this engine: its results anchor cross-function equalities asserted to
# <1e-9 in the self-test, so it stays byte-identical to the original scipy path.

    The naive way to do this -- stack [E; -E] and run one NNLS -- is degenerate: for any
    gene the solver can trivially use either +e or -e, the combined generator set spans a
    much larger space, and the "how much needs activation" question dissolves because
    everything looks reachable. We instead answer the decision question directly:

        1. LOF fit:  w* = argmin_{w>=0} ||E^T w - d||         (the real knockdown reach)
        2. residual after LOF:  r = d - E^T w*
        3. GOF fit on the residual:  u* = argmin_{u>=0} ||(-E_gof)^T u - r||
           -- i.e. how much of what knockdown COULD NOT reach is reachable by activation.
        4. final residual: rho = r - (-E_gof)^T u*  (reachable by neither direction)

    Because step 3 fits the LOF residual, the three squared-norm shares are (near-)exactly
    orthogonal and sum to ~1. This staged fit encodes the biological prior that knockdown is
    the assay we actually have, and activation is the additional modality we are QUANTIFYING
    the need for -- not a free generator to be used interchangeably.

    value multiset -- hence its mean, its norm, and therefore the fraction of its energy that
    lies along the uniform ("all-genes") direction. That surviving component is what lets a
    non-negative cone score a high cosine by chance whenever the dictionary has a shared,
    same-sign transcriptional signature (e.g. a common activation/stress axis). Decomposing a
    shuffled target into (uniform component) + (mean-zero residual), which the cone reaches
    through two ORTHOGONAL channels, gives

        E[null cosine]  ~  sqrt( (a . rho1)^2  +  (1 - a^2) . kappa )

    where
        a^2   = G * mean(d)^2 / ||d||^2      the target's DC / anisotropy fraction (shuffle-invariant),
        rho1  = reachable cosine of the uniform direction 1 (a fixed property of the dictionary),
        kappa = chance reachable cosine^2 for a random MEAN-ZERO target (the isotropic AC floor).

    Validated against shuffled-target nulls on synthetic dictionaries (Pearson(pred, empirical)
    ~ 0.999 held-out / 0.995 in-sample; RMSE ~ 0.03-0.046) and on the primary CD4 Rest
    dictionary across four target axes (max abs error ~0.05 in-sample, ~0.07 held-out): it
    reproduces both the ~0 null of a sign-balanced target (Th1/Th2) and the elevated ~0.26-0.34
    null of an up-dominated target (CD4 aging) that a naive z-against-zero would mistake for
    signal. `rho1` and `kappa` are estimated with a handful of NNLS solves, so the analytic
    null replaces ~1000 shuffles by ~10-20 fits.

    verified in `_selftest`):

    * refit_full=False (default, FAST): orthogonal-matching-pursuit style. At each step,
      score every candidate generator by its correlation with the current residual, add the
      best, then refit NNLS once on the small active set. Cost ~ O(k_max) NNLS solves plus
      k_max cheap (P x G)@(G,) scorings — seconds at P~7000.
    * refit_full=True  (EXHAUSTIVE ONE-STEP GREEDY, SLOW): at each step, try adding each

      pick the one that maximises the refit cosine. Cost ~ O(k_max x P) NNLS solves —
      minutes-to-hours at P~7000. It is exact for each greedy step, not for the global

        This steers the recipe toward reaching the target with less magnitude inflation --
        i.e. toward a set whose *additive* prediction is more likely to hold in real
        co-perturbation. 1.0 is a full saturation discount; ~0.5 is a moderate nudge. The

# Additivity / epistasis model  (calibrated on measured double perturbations)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The reachable-cone method composes single-knockdown effect vectors ADDITIVELY. That
# assumption was calibrated against the one public screen that measures both singles and
# their doubles: Norman et al. 2019 (K562 CRISPRa, GSE133344), 126 doubles with both
# singles present. Two candidate epistasis mechanisms were tested against the measured
# non-additivity of each double:
#
#   * effect-vector COLLINEARITY (the intuitive "shared-program => sub-additive" prior):
#     Spearman rho ~ -0.16 with directional non-additivity (n.s.). REFUTED as a predictor
#     -- collinear pairs are, if anything, slightly MORE additive. Do not penalise on it.
#   * combined MAGNITUDE (saturation ceiling): Spearman rho ~ +0.58 (p<0.01) with the
#     magnitude deficit 1 - ||measured|| / ||additive||. ROBUST and biologically sensible:
#     you cannot push a gene's expression arbitrarily far, so stacking large effects yields
#     less than their sum. This is the calibrated penalty.
#
# The saturation law   achieved = a / (1 + a / (M* . s))   fits the Norman doubles with
# R^2 ~ 0.57, where `a` is the additive-predicted magnitude ||Sum_i w_i E_i||, `s` is the
# dictionary's median single-effect (row) norm, and M* is a dimensionless ceiling. Dividing
# by `s` makes the law SCALE-FREE, so the ceiling calibrated on Norman log-fold-change
# transfers to a z-score dictionary. Directional (angular) non-additivity, by contrast,
# improves with effect size (median cos(measured, additive) 0.64 -> 0.81 from the weakest to
# the strongest magnitude quartile), i.e. it is largely measurement noise at low SNR, so the
# calibrated model corrects only the magnitude channel and leaves the fit DIRECTION intact.
# (SATURATION_CEILING is defined near the top of the module so it can be a default argument
#  of reachability_spectrum.)

    This is the one-call researcher-facing API. Given a measured knockdown effect
    dictionary `E` (P perturbations x G readout genes) and a target transcriptomic shift
    `d` (G,), it returns a complete, self-qualifying *design card*:

      1. VERDICT  — is the target reachable? (null-calibrated: 'outside' when held-out
         reach is indistinguishable from a shuffled target, never a hardcoded cosine cut).
      2. RECIPE   — the ranked knockdown recipe AND the ranked activation recipe, split by
         the signed LOF/GOF/neither decomposition (so 'what to do' comes with 'in which
         direction', i.e. CRISPRi vs CRISPRa).
      3. LIBRARY  — the optimal k-perturbation set for the NEXT screen, from the greedy
         reachability spectrum, with the knee (`optimal_k`) detected automatically.
      4. CERTIFICATE — positive unmet readouts at the closest knockdown-cone point; together
         they contribute to the Farkas separating direction and motivate CRISPRa hypotheses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    E : (P, G) array          measured knockdown effect dictionary; row p is perturbation p.
    d : (G,)  array           target shift (current->target), on the same G gene axis as E.
    perturbation_names : length-P list, optional
        Name of the perturbed gene for each generator row -> names the recipe/library.
    readout_names : length-G list, optional
        Name of each readout gene -> names the activation certificate. If `hvg_mask` is
        given these are indexed on the FULL G axis (masking is applied internally).
    hvg_mask : (G,) bool, optional      restrict the fit to these readout genes.
    gof_mask : (P,) bool, optional      which perturbations may act as activation generators.
    k_max : int               how far to extend the greedy library spectrum.
    top : int                 how many recipe entries to return per direction.
    n_shuffles : int          held-out-gene shuffles for the significance gate; 0 skips it
                              (verdict then geometry-only, null_calibrated=False).
    cert_top : int            how many activation-certificate genes to return.
    seed : int                RNG seed for the held-out split & null.

    Returns
    -------
    DesignResult   (call .summary() for a one-liner; see the dataclass fields).

    Notes
    -----
    Modelling assumption (stated plainly, inherited from `signed_reachability`): activation
    of a gene is approximated by the sign-flip of its measured knockdown effect vector. The
    activation recipe and certificate are therefore falsifiable CRISPRa *hypotheses*, not a
    claim that activation exactly mirrors knockdown. The held-out cosine is the honest
    generalisation number; the in-sample `reachable_cosine` typically overstates it, which is
    exactly what the calibration/reliability analysis quantifies.
