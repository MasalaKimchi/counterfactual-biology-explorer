# Cell-State Reachability Oracle — Manuscript Source

Preprint manuscript + standalone Limitations & Reinforcement Plan for the
convex-cone cell-state reachability oracle (Built with Claude, Life Sciences).

## Build
The paper is formatted with the **official ICML 2026 style** in `[preprint]` mode
(two-column, non-anonymous, honest "Preprint" footer — no false acceptance notice).
All required style files ship in this directory, so the build is self-contained and
needs only a standard `pdflatex` + `bibtex` (e.g. a full TinyTeX/TeX Live):

```
pdflatex main && bibtex main && pdflatex main && pdflatex main
pdflatex limitations_and_reinforcement_plan   # (x2)
```

Bundled style dependencies (do not delete): `icml2026.sty`, `icml2026.bst`,
`fancyhdr.sty`, `algorithm.sty`, `algorithmic.sty`, plus `forloop.sty` and
`multido.sty` (required by `icml2026.sty`, not always present in minimal TeX
installs). `main.tex` also loads `fontenc`+`inputenc` so accented author names in
the bibliography (Barabási, González-Blas, Zañudo, …) render correctly.

## Layout
- `main.tex`                — preprint driver (preamble + \input of sections/)
- `sections/`               — 00_abstract, 10_introduction, 20_methods,
                              30_results, 40_related_work, 50_discussion, 90_supplement
- `references.bib`          — verified BibTeX entries (Replogle2022 and Mejia2026 added
                              for the reinforcement threads; Moreau1962 and KuhnTucker1951
                              for the convex-analysis foundations). Replogle2022 verified
                              by DOI (OpenAlex) and PMID (PubMed E-utilities); Mejia2026 is
                              the ICML 2026 poster "Needles in the Haystack: Addressing
                              Signal Dilution..." (OpenReview XsrXLPxBJw; expanded preprint
                              bioRxiv 2025.10.20.683304); 0 fabricated.
                              Barabási author name corrected from a malformed "Albert-Ĺaszló"
                              (U+0139) to "Albert-László" — the stray codepoint was truncated by
                              8-bit bibtex into invalid UTF-8 in the .bbl.
- `figures/`                — fig1-5 (main) + figS1-9 (supp), each as 300 dpi PNG + vector PDF
                              (figS5-9 added: DEG-weighting, calibration, cross-cell-type
                              transfer, certificate split-stability, certificate cross-reference)
- `manuscript_facts.json`   — locked single-source-of-truth facts sheet (every number in the
                              text is verbatim from here)
- `limitations_and_reinforcement_plan.tex` — standalone self-critique (also embedded as the
                              paper's Discussion)
- `editorial_verdict.json`  — paper-narrative handling-editor arc assessment
- `verification_log.csv`    — per-citation verification record (in the citations artifacts)
